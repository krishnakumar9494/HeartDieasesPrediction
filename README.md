# Heart Dieases Prediction Using Machine learning Algorithms
# Abstract
Day by day the cases of heart diseases are increasing at a rapid rate and it’s very
Important and concerning to predict any such diseases beforehand. This diagnosis is a
difficult task i.e. it should be performed precisely and efficiently. The research paper
mainly focuses on which patient is more likely to have a heart disease based on various
medical attributes. We prepared a heart disease prediction system to predict whether the
patient is likely to be diagnosed with a heart disease or not using the medical history of
the patient. We used different algorithms of machine learning such as logistic regression
and KNN to predict and classify the patient with heart disease. A quite Helpful approach
was used to regulate how the model can be used to improve the accuracy of prediction
of Heart Attack in any individual. The strength of the proposed model was quiet satisfying
and was able to predict evidence of having a heart disease in a particular individual by
using KNN and Logistic Regression which showed a good accuracy in comparison to the
previously used classifier such as naïve bayes etc. So a quiet significant amount of
pressure has been lift off by using the given model in finding the probability of the classifier
to correctly and accurately identify the heart disease. The Given heart disease prediction
system enhances medical care and reduces the cost. This project gives us significant
knowledge that can help us predict the patients with heart disease It is implemented on
the.pynb format.
